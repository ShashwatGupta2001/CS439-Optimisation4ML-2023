# CS439-Optimisation4ML-EPFL
This repository contains the code for the Optimization for Machine Learning (CS439) Project done by  Shashwat Gupta (shashwat.gupta@epfl.ch) and Sebastien Meguel (sebastian.breguelgonzalez@epfl.ch). The code supplements further investigation that we did regarding the Minimax Algorithm for Nonconvex-Nonconcavre optimisation problem (Keswani et. al, 2020)

The code has 3 parts:

1. MATLAB Files for the 3 algorithms - GDA, OMD, and Keswani's Algorithm. The files have pre-implemented set of 11 challenging functions (along with x and y-gradients) and a plotting facility
   
2. Figure plots for 11 functions obtained after running MATLAB code.
   
3. Additional .ipynb notebook to investigate the effect of various optimizers on GDA and Keswani's Algorithm (We did not implement this because of Hardware and report size constraints)
